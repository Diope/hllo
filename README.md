So this is me working on another medium sized app just to keep my knowledge up to date and because I enjoy coding. Not sure how far I'll go with this, but for the time being it'll be the bare basics of a social media app. So registration,
posting, deleting of posts. I might add in image hosting via AWS or Firestore, not sure. I'm trying to limit feature creep which ultimately dooms most projects I start.
